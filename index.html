                However, unlike food based recipes, life doesn’t provide you with standardized ingredients as each lives

                <h3>Yogurt</h3>
                <p>Yogurt is a secret ingredient used in a variety of cakes to create a super moist, light, and fluffy
                    texture. It adds a special something, a hint of tangy lusciousness to every bite! The fun part is
                    that you can use anything from plain yogurt to your favorite flavored yogurt — strawberry, lemon,
                    vanilla, and more. From Greek yogurt cake and yogurt pound cake to an easy French yogurt cake that's
                    perfect for an after-school treat.

                <h3>Spicy Salsa</h3>
                <p>Delightfully fresh and with a kick of heat, you can't beat homemade spicy salsa. Usually featuring a
                    blend of vibrant ingredients like tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and plenty of pepper varieties, you'll
                    have a hard time ever going back to jarred salsa after the first bite. Whip up a batch for your next
                    Taco Tuesday, or keep a bowl handy for snacking with chips during a movie marathon.

                <p>If there's one thing we know about kids, it's that they love snacks. And asking for snacks. Like, all
                    the time. Maybe it's time you taught them how to make their own healthy snacks. Here are 14 healthy
                    snacks easy enough for kids to make. You'll want to supervise your youngest, of course, but older
                    kids can pitch in and help, too.
